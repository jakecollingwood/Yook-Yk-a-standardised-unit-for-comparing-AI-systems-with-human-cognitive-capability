CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION 4.0 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC LICENSE

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 — Definitions.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.

Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and similar international agreements.

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License — in this case, Jake Collingwood.

Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended, extended, or replaced.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 — Scope.

1. Grant of Copyright and Similar Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
   a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
   b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2. Exceptions and Limitations; No endorsement.
   a. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
   b. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a waiver of the Licensor’s moral rights or other similar rights that may exist under applicable law, or as an endorsement by the Licensor of You or Your use.
   c. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material, to the extent that the Licensor’s rights in the Licensed Material are limited by Sui Generis Database Rights, the Licensor grants You the rights to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

3. Term. The term of this Public License is perpetual unless terminated as provided in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; Technological measures. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) never produces Adapted Material.

5. Downstream recipients.
   a. Offer from the Licensor — If You Share the Licensed Material, the Licensor offers the same license to the recipient.
   b. No downstream restrictions — You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material that restrict the exercise of the Licensed Rights by recipients.

Section 3 — License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

1. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
   a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:

   f. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License and include the text “CC BY 4.0” or a link to the license.

2. No endorsement. Nothing in the attribution requirement constitutes or may be interpreted as a representation that the Licensor endorses You or Your use.

Section 4 — Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
1. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 2 grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
2. If You extract, reuse, reproduce, or Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database, You must comply with the conditions in Section 3 (Attribution).

2. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.

Section 6 — Term and Termination.

1. This Public License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Public License. Individuals or entities who have received Adapted Material or Licensed Material from You under this Public License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
2. Subject to the above, this Public License will continue in effect for the term of the applicable Copyright and Similar Rights. Notwithstanding the above, the Licensor reserves the right to offer the Licensed Material under different terms or to stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not withdraw this Public License (or any other license that has been granted under it).
